# cs12b-Dictionary
There are three programs that work together to make a dictionary. Term is a program that takes in an array of words and organizes it alphabetically or by weight. Binary Search Deluxe assumes that an array is organized and it looks for a specific word. Autocomplete takes in information from Term and Binary Search Deluxe to output a list of words that has the same prefix.
